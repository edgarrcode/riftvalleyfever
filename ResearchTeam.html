                                <p>Over his career with the Department of Defense, he held several key scientific and administrative positions that enabled him to acquire extensive experience in managing, advising, and directing research on enteric, parasitic and viral diseases in Asia, Africa, and South America.</p>
                                <p>During Dr. Wattsâ€™ tenure at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston from 2002 to 2008, and in his current position as the Executive Director of Veterinary Services and Institutional Biosafety, and the Co-Director of the Border Biomedical Research Center at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), he developed and evaluated candidate therapeutics and vaccines for Severe Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome, dengue, yellow fever, monkey pox and West Nile viruses.</p>
                                <p>As the Principal Investigator of this project, he provides program guidance and technical leadership across the project, working closely with the Project Director to monitor and ensure that the project aims are achieved within the projected timeframe and budget.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Watts is experienced in select agent research and familiar with the ecology and epidemiology of Rift Valley fever, especially the history and status of vaccine development.  He is also knowledgeable and proficient in RVFV laboratory methodologies.  In addition to his overall responsibilities as the P.I., Dr. Watts will lead bioassay development to serologically distinguish animals that have been infected previously with RVF from those that were vaccinated with the MP-12-NSm-del vaccine.  He will assist with the transfer of these research and development technologies to the Sokoine University of Agricultural site in Tanzania.</p>

Further, she successfully recovered and characterized viral replication kinetics of rMP12-GM50, which encodes silent mutations at each 50 nucleotide in open-reading frame of all genes.</p>
                                <p>She optimized conditions for cell culture of mosquito cells, and mouse infection model to start co-infection experiment, while developed a multiplex PCR to distinguish S-, M- and L-segment of MP-12 from those of rMP12-GM50 in a single PCR reaction. She wrote a first-author book chapter in <em>Methods in Molecular Biology</em> (Springer) about an application of droplet digital PCR in RVFV vaccine development in 2014. She is expected to be a graduate student at UTMB in 2015, and will further support the USAID project.</p>
