<p>The University of Texas at EL Paso (UTEP) Texas was awarded a 5 year Cooperative Agreement (USAID Cooperative Agreement AID-OAA-A-13-00084 FTF-Rift Valley Fever Vaccine) in September, 2103 by the United Stated Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop and evaluate the RVF MP-12 and derivative vaccine candidates for protecting livestock in Tanzania. Collaborating arrangements to include the expertise of other institutions were established by UTEP with investigators with relevant subject matter and technical expertise at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston, Texas, the Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), Morogoro, Tanzania, and the MCI Sante Animale, Mohammedia, Morocco because of the extensive scope and technical complexity of the project.</p>

<p>Animals like cattle, goat and sheep play a major role in initiating and maintaining the RVFV epidemic transmission cycle (1). We propose to develop RVF arMP12-NSm-del as a DIVA animal vaccine for use in Africa to help prevent outbreaks and spread of RVFV by vaccination of animals in endzootic zones. Based on existing data, rMP12-NSm-del vaccine has the potential to provide life-long immunity and therefore, eliminate the need for repeated seasonal vaccinations. This will help reduce the human exposure to the disease and is expected to improve overall public health and reduce economic losses by limiting the extent, severity and duration of an outbreak (1). The specific aims of this project are to 1) Develop the arMP12-NSm-del RVFV animal vaccine for use in Africa that induces a DIVA protective immunity, and that is given by needle free delivery, allowing farmers and pastoralists to easily administer the vaccine. 2) Develop an ELISA assay for the detection of DIVA vaccinated animals and transfer it to Africa, and 3) Adapt manufacturing technology already developed for MP-12, the parent virus and transfer it to Africa to produce the vaccine. The research effort will is led by the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) with a focus on establishing an enzyme linked adsorbent assay (ELISA) to detect DIVA vaccinated animals. We plan to develop the ELISA and Western Blot assays for detecting serum antibody to NSm and NSs, and to validate the assays using existing panels of serum from sheep and cattle previously vaccinated with either MP-12 (NSm and NSs positive) and the vaccine candidate (NSm negative, NSs positive). Once the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is established, the assays will be modified to yield a simple to perform hand-held field deployable assay that will be transferred to the Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) to further evaluate and validate the assays using appropriate sera from indigenous cattle and sheep. Also, both locations will screen normal serum from indigenous cattle to determine the specificity of the assays, especially to determine if there are any false positive assay issues.</p>

<p>The use of a live, attenuated vaccine based solely on a gene deletion requires careful considerations because of the possibility of reversion to virulence. This could occur by genetic recombination and/or reassortment in the field with another virus resulting in a vaccine virus recovering the deleted phenotype and becoming virulent. This has happened with a chicken vaccine (2), and if it occurred with a RVF vaccine could be catastrophic and introduce the disease where it was absent. Reassortment of RNAs segments between RVFV occurred during the use of the Smithburn Neurotropic Vaccine (SNV) during a RVFV outbreak in South Africa (3). This resulted in the unintended emergence of reassortant RVFV encoding the S- and L-segments of virulent RVFV and the M-segment of a SNV-like sequence (26), demonstrating that this event can occur in the field with widely used vaccination. The use of a RVF vaccine like Clone-13 that is based solely on the deletion of the NSs gene poses a potential risk of reassortment of the vaccine strain with circulating asymptomatic Bunyaviruses or other viruses having segmented RNA genomes that, if the NSs phenotype is recovered, could lead to a RVF outbreak in an area otherwise free of active disease (4, 5). The arMP12-NSm-del attenuated vaccine is different because it retains the MP-12 attenuation is based on SNP mutations on L and M segments that is stable by both phenotypic and genetic sequence analysis (6). The NSm deletion is not expected to affect this stability. We will test the arMP12-NSm-del DIVA vaccine, MP-12 and the MP-12-NSsdel virus for the ability to undergo reassortment with other bunyaviruses in both tissue culture and in mice. Exchange of NSs in nature has been reported for RVFV as well as with Hantavirus, another bunyavirus (7, 8, 9). The safety of this study is insured by using the arMP12-NSm-del virus, since any NSs or NSm recombination will result in MP-12, an attenuated virus. The results of these studies will increase the confidence for using this attenuated vaccine in animals.</p>

<p>Vaccinating animals in the field presents unique challenges, one of which is the use of needles for delivering the vaccine. Studies have shown that the intramuscular (im) delivery of vaccines bypasses the dendritic cells responses of the dermal immune system (10). Sub-cutaneous (sc) or intradermal (id) routes often result in improved responses and can be vaccine sparing. Re-used needles are also a potential vector of disease when inoculating large herds. We will test a needle free injection (NFI) device made by Bioject, Inc. that has a multiple, large dosing device or an easy to use, durable injector with pre-filled, disposable syringes. We will determine the minimum effective dose of vaccine by this ID route in rats based on the neutralizing antibody titer response. This has proven to be a surrogate for challenge testing, and eliminates the need for handling the highly infectious virulent form of RVFV and the requirement for ABSL-3 or ABSL-4 biocontainment facilities. Prior studies have shown that the minimum effective dose (MED) in rodents can be used in larger animals (11). We will transfer the NFI technology to SUA for later use in testing the arMP12NSm-del vaccine in animals.</p>

<p>After in-country government approvals, SUA will perform a dose escalation test of the vaccine in RVFV seronegative sheep and cattle using the NFI route of vaccination. Animals will receive a single ID vaccination using increasing doses of vaccine based on previous studies using rats. One group will be a placebo control and another given the standard MP-12 dose of 5-log10 pfu by the ID route. The animals will be followed for 4 months, and the dose providing the peak level of neutralizing RVFV antibody will be selected for a pivotal test in cattle. Cattle will be vaccinated with the optimum dose of the test vaccine arMP-12NSm-del determined in the dose escalation study, including MP-12 (positive control) or saline (negative control). The animals will be followed for 12 months to determine the immune response and persistence of protection against RVFV infection and/or disease.</p>

<p>Finally, we plan to adapt the manufacturing process already developed for MP-12 for use in making arMP12-NSm-del vaccine at the M.C.I. Sant√© Animale's pharmaceutical production facility in Mohammedia 28810, Morocco. We have qualified in-process assays of cell growth based on nutrient and metabolite levels and virus production using NSs gene copy numbers. The manufacturing process uses disposable equipment and results in high titer virus that in frozen bulk is calculated to cost <$0.10 per dose for human use, and could be half that for animal use. It is stable when frozen, and virus made 25 years ago retains full potency (pfu/ml). We will use reverse genetics to synthesize a new arMP12-NSm-del virus using animal protein free products and suitable for making a Master Virus Seed and Working Virus Seed, but not part of this proposal.</p>

<p>We plan a technology transfer of the DIVA assay and the manufacturing process and materials to a facility to be identified in Africa. This project will result in a DIVA marked arMP12NSm-del RVFV vaccine for use in Africa with demonstrated protective efficacy based on neutralizing antibody. It will require only a single dose given by needle free means, and provides extended protection, most likely lifetime.</p>

<p>All studies at SUA and MCI will be conducted in Biosafety Level 2 facilities in accordance with the CDC & P Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th Edition, December 2009 Guide Full Version of Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th Edition and the USAID Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) regulations, 2013 2018, and the UTEP Institutional Biosafety protocol, approval #559108-1 and Institutional Animal Care and Use protocol, approval #A-201401-1. All vaccine waste will be disposed of in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) at SUA and MCI which will be to decontaminate liquid waste with 10% household bleach and to incinerate solid laboratory waste. Cattle and sheep will be kept in the vector free environment up-to 35 days after receiving the RVF vaccine. At the end of each experiment, cattle and sheep will euthanized with an overdose of barbiturate (pentobarbital) and then incinerated according to SOP at SUA and MCI. The feces and urine of cattle and sheep will be disposed of each day in an open covered and secured pit. All participants in this project are experienced infectious diseases investigators who are aware and capable of complying with appropriate biosafety regulations and practices. Furthermore, all biosafety and use of animals practices will be performed in compliance with UTEP approved Institutional Biosafety (IBC) and Institutional Animal Care and Use (IACUC) protocols.</p>
