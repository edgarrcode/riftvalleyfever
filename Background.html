                <h2>History of the Rift Valley Fever and the Development of Rift Valley Fever Vaccines</h2>
                <p>Since the discovery of Rift Valley fever (RVF) as the cause of an outbreak among sheep and human during the early 1930s in the Rift Valley in Kenya, the disease has emerged as one of the most important zoonoses in Africa. The disease has and continues to affect the health of thousands to millions of humans and animals, and the livestock industry has lost millions of dollars, and therefore, affecting hundreds of millions of those whose livelihood depends on livestock, exaggerating poverty on already deprived communities.</p>
                <p><img src="images/gal13.jpg" alt="" title="" class="pictureFrame"></p>
                <p>The etiology of RVF, or Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne viral pathogen that primarily affects ruminants and humans in Africa, Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar <sup class="reference">(1 – 3)</sup>. As a negative-stranded RNA virus of the genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae, this viral pathogen is transmitted by mosquitoes, but the vast majority of animal and human infection is contracted by contact with infected animal tissue and secretions.</p>
                <p>While outbreaks have traditionally occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, recent outbreaks in the Middle East have raised awareness of the potential of this virus to spread to Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Although RVFV is currently exotic to North America, it is on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Select Agent list. The virus is also considered as a potential bioterrorist threat.</p>
                <p>Approved therapeutic and prophylactic measures for RVF are not available. Several candidate vaccines have been developed, but none have been approved for use in humans and animals in the United States <sup class="reference">(4)</sup>. Among the most promising vaccine candidates, the RVF MP-12 live attenuated mutagenized vaccine was derived from a virulent Egyptian strain of RVFV (strain ZH548) that was isolated from a human patient <sup class="reference">(5)</sup>. This vaccine was attenuated by 12 serial passages of the virulent RVFV in human diploid MRC-5 cells in the presence of the chemical mutagen 5-fluorouracil. Studies indicated that the Large, Medium and Small segments of the viral genome accumulated 9, 12 and 4 mutations, respectively <sup class="reference">(6)</sup>. RVF MP-12 is highly immunogenic and induces protective antibody in ruminants, and also induces a robust protective immune response in humans <sup class="reference">(7-12)</sup>. RVF MP-12 vaccine was produced in certified MRC-5 cells as an FDA approved Investigational New Drug (BB-4307) for human clinical trials and was shown to be safe and immunogenic in human volunteers <sup class="reference">(13)</sup>. Genetic characterizations of the subpopulations of RVF MP-12 vaccine Lot 7-2-88 showed that the vaccine retains highly stable attenuation mutations in the M- and L-segments during its cultivation in MRC-5 cells, thus indicating that there was no potential for reversion to virulence <sup class="reference">(13)</sup>. The excellent safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the RVF MP-12 vaccine in humans and livestock was deemed sufficient by the Division of the Select Agents and Toxins to exclude the RVF MP-12 vaccine virus from the Select Agent rule because it does not pose a threat to Public Health and Safety.</p>
                <p>Also, a conditional license was awarded during 2013 by the USDA to Zoetis, Inc, USA and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for emergency use of the RVF MP-12 vaccine to respond to a possible outbreak of RVFV among livestock in the United States  and Canada.</p>
                <p>At least two RVF MP-12 recombinant nucleotide deletion vaccine were developed at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston, Texas to protect livestock and humans from the devastating health impact of RVF disease. In addition to the parent RVF MP-12 vaccine, reverse genetic technology was employed by investigators at UTMB to develop a modified RVF MP 12 referred to as a modified arMP-12, and two deletion vaccine candidates referred to as arMP-12NSm-deletion (nucleotides 21/384) and arMP-12NSs-deletion (nucleotides 16/198). The purpose of developing the candidate vaccines with deleted genes is to enhance attenuation and to produce vaccines with biomarkers that will make it possible to distinguish the immune response of vaccinated animals from that of naturally infected animals. Such a vaccine termed DIVA is essential to allow for the identification of RVFV free animals which is required for export of livestock from and to countries in and outside of Africa as a critical source of financial income. Although, the RVF MP-12 derivative vaccines produced by reverse genetic technology have not been tested as extensively as the attenuated RVF MP-12 vaccine, the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccines, including the arMP-12, and arMP-12 NSm-del (21/384) in rodent, sheep and cattle are similar to that of the parent RVF MP-12 vaccine.</p><h3>References</h3><ol>    <li>Ikegami T, Makino S, 2011.

                <h2>Summary of the Publications on the Development of Rift Valley Fever MP-12 Vaccine</h2>
                <p>In 1985, the attenuated Rift Valley fever virus RVF MP-12 vaccine was derived by 12 passages of the virulent RVFV ZH548 strain in human diploid MRC-5 cells in the presence of the chemical mutagen 5-fluorouracil and the mutagenized virus was named MVP 12 (later named MP-12) (Caplen et al., 1985, Morrill et al., 1987). </p>
                <p>Each of the three RVFV virion genome segments (Large (L), Medium (M) and Small (S)) contained attenuating or temperature-sensitive mutations (Saluzzo and Smith, 1990) and a subsequent study showed that the L, M and S segments contained 9, 12 and 4 mutations, respectively (Vialat et al., 1997).</p>
                <p>The efficacy of the RVF MP-12 vaccine to protect ewes was demonstrated in pregnant ewes that were in the second trimester of gestation. The animals developed a low-level viremia but no evidence of clinical illness and the ewes delivered healthy lambs. Postpartum challenge of the MP-12-vaccinated ewes with virulent RVFV demonstrated that the vaccine conferred protection of the animals from clinical disease (Morrill et al., 1987).</p>
                <p>A subsequent study confirmed the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in gestating ewes by demonstrating that young lambs did not develop untoward effects after vaccination, other than a pyrexia and transient low-level viremia. All lambs were protected from challenge with a virulent strain of RVFV 14 days after vaccination (Morrill et al., 1991).</p>
                <p>Similar to the results in sheep, RVF MP-12 vaccination of gestating cattle resulted in low-level viremia, but no untoward effects and all vaccinated animals were protected from abortion and clinical disease (Morrill et al., 1997a). </p>
                <p>A study on the effects of in utero inoculation of RVF MP-12 led the authors to suggest that fetal death and abortion following vaccination of gestating cows would be rare even when the fetus would be exposed to the MP-12 virus (Morrill et al., 1997b).</p>
                <p>Studies to determine the pathogenicity and neurovirulence of RVF MP-12 in non-human primates revealed that the vaccine was not entirely innocuous but that residual pathological lesions were mild and in the order of severity of those observed in similar experiments with the 17D yellow fever vaccine (Morrill and Peters, 2003). </p>
                <p>Subsequent vaccine efficacy studies performed in rhesus macaques via the intramuscular route did not cause any clinical signs and the challenge of these animals with virulent RVFV indicated that they were protected from clinical illness and a viremia (Morrill and Peters, 2011b). Also, a follow-up study demonstrated that vaccination via different mucosal routes prevented clinical illness and a viremia (Morrill and Peters, 2011a).</p>
                <p>The potency and safety of the RVF MP-12 vaccine was studied in human trials involving 63 volunteers under an approved FDA IND and the results revealed that there were no serious adverse reactions and no evidence of reversion of the vaccine to virulence (Peters and Linthicum, 1994; Kortekaas et al., 2011b).</p>
                <p>The magnitudes of viremia observed in vaccinated animals in all of these studies were below the concentrations believed to be transmissible by mosquito vectors (Turrell et al.,1991). </p>
                <p>Spread and shed of the RVF MP-12 vaccine virus from vaccinated animals and humans has not been observed, and therefore, it is unlikely that humans could be exposed to RVF vaccine strain during the proposed field and laboratory safety studies in Morocco and Tanzania (Environmental Assessment, 2013, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Zoetis Canada Inc.). </p>
                <p>A study at Pfizer (Zoetis) in which two sentinel animals were commingled with RVF MP-12  vaccinated animals. All vaccinated animals seroconverted to the vaccine virus, but none of the sentinel animals seroconverted, indicating that no vaccine virus spread to susceptible animals. Also, virus was not isolated from any vaccinated or control animals in serum, nasal, or fecal samples (Environmental Assessment, 2013, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA),  Zoetis Canada Inc.). </p>
                <p>Summary of Publications on the Development of Rift Valley Fever MP-12 Recombinant Deletion Vaccines</p>
                <p>arRVF MP-12 vaccine and deletion vaccines including RVF  arMP12-NSm-del (21/384) and RVF MP-12NSs-del (16/198) vaccines were made by reverse genetics technology using the RVF MP-12 consensus RNA sequence bit having nucleotides 21-384 and 16-198 deleted in the non-structural regions of the genome segments, respectively. Ikegami etal. 2006; Won etal.  2007 </p>
                <p>A preliminary study on the immunogenicity of both candidates revealed that the deletion arMP-12 NSs-del (16/198) vaccine induced a poor neutralizing antibody response as compared to a robust immune response by the arMP-12 NSm-del (21/384) vaccine. Further evaluation of the arMP-12 NSm-del (21/384) showed this vaccines virus to induce protective antibody in gestating ewes and in calves, and the results indicated that the arMP-12 NSm-del (21/384) was at least as potent as the parental RVF MP-12 virus in the induction of neutralizing antibodies. Also, the absence of the NSm gene provides a potential platform for developing a DIVA vaccine. (Morrill et al., 2013a and Morrill et al., 2013b). </p>
                <p>Results from a more recent study revealed that arMP-12 NSm-del (21/384) vaccine induced antibody in sheep that afforded protection of these animals against challenge with virulent RVFV (Weingartl et al., 2014). </p>
                <p>In conclusion, the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of arMP-12, MP-12 NSm-del (21/384) and MP-12NSs-del (16/198) vaccine in rodent, sheep and cattle is similar to that of the parent RVF MP-12 vaccine.</p>
