                <p><strong>The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB)</strong> is one of the leading institutions for infectious disease research. Institute for Human Infections &amp; Immunity (IHII) is the world-class infectious disease research programs covering from basic to translational infectious disease and immunology researches, and serves as the research hub of various centers and programs at UTMB: Galveston National Laboratory (GNL) and the Robert E. Shope M.D. Laboratory provide 96,000 ft.sq. biocontainment laboratory space, which allows the studies using highly pathogenic pathogens such as Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Lassa virus, Junin virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Nipah/Hendra virus, SARS, MERS, avian influenza, West Nile virus, anthrax, plague, typhus, drug-resistant tuberculosis and others. Sealy Center for Vaccine Development (SCVD) consisting of more than 80 faculty members shares expertise to promote vaccine development for infectious and non-infectious diseases and to support education and training activities for vaccinology. Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases (CBEID) consisting of more than 60 researchers works to strengthen countermeasures of the U.S. against biological weapons or terrorisms. World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Tropical Diseases supports the programs toward the control of Tropical diseases. World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) serves as a virus reference center for the world, and supports identification and basic characterization of arboviruses. Uses of biological agents, recombinant materials, human and non-human primate products are evaluated and approved by Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), while the use of animals is reviewed and approved by institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). UTMB’s Animal Resources Center (ARC) encompasses 72,847 sq. ft. and is AAALAC (Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory and Care International) accredited. To facilitate the collaborations among research groups, the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) at UTMB supports the intellectual Property management, material transfer, commercialization and others. In this USAID project, UTMB research team (PI: Dr. Tetsuro Ikegami) performs basic research using Rift Valley fever virus MP-12 vaccine, and other bunyaviruses such as Arumowot virus, Gouleako virus or Bunyamwera virus to understand the potential of genetic reassortant and recombination between bunyaviruses, in collaboration with the research team at UT EP. </p>

                <p><strong>MCI Sante Animale</strong> is a private biopharmaceutical company based in Morocco that was started in 1991 and specializes in the manufacture and development of animal medicines and vaccines (viral and bacterial). In 2010 it was certified by Merial for the contract manufacture of some of their vaccine products.  MCI was certified as a cGMP research and manufacturing facility in 2003 according to European Directive 91/412/CEE, principles and guidelines of Good Manufacturing Practice for veterinary medicinal products. In 2009, M.C.I. Santé Animale obtained a triple certification for Quality, Safety and Environment according to the requirements of ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS18001. MCI has the technical and facilities capability to conduct research in support of the development of bacterial and viral vaccines, including BSL-2 and BSL-3 in-vitro research labs. The facility has one each of an  Animal Biosafety Level -2 (ABSL 2) and Animal Biosafety Level -3 (ABSL 3) animal pen able to house 6-8 sheep or weanling calves for periods of up to 4 weeks.  A contract research organization from South Africa is building larger scale ABSL-2/3 space (30-40 animals) that should be ready in one year. Of particular relevance to MCI’s capability to work safely and contain RVF vaccines, the institution has been working on RVF vaccine previously developed in South Africa and has not experienced any untoward events. Overall, MCI has the Biosafety infrastructure and expertise and facilities to contain and use the RVF MP-12 vaccines in Biosafety Level 2 facilities in accordance with the USAID Initial Environmental Examination and the CDC &amp; P Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th Edition, December 2009 Guide, and in compliance with the University of Texas at EL Paso Institutional Biosafety (IBC) and Institutional Animal Care and Use (IACUC) regulations and policies. The MCI Project Director of our USAID supported project on the evaluation of RVF vaccines for protecting livestock provided a letter stating that SUA would comply with UTEP’s Institutional Biosafety and Institutional Animal Care and Use Regulations and Practices (See attached letter dated August 21, 2014 from Dr. Baptiste Dungu. Overall, SUA will have the Biosafety infrastructure and expertise and facilities to contain and use the RVF MP-12 vaccines in Biosafety Level 2 facilities in accordance with the USAID’s Initial Environmental Examination and the CDC &amp; P BMBL 5th Edition, December 2009, and in compliance with the University of Texas at EL Paso’s (UTEP) Institutional Biosafety and Institutional Animal Care and Use regulations and policies.</p>

                <p><strong>The Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA)</strong> is the only agricultural University in Tanzania that takes a leading role in research on agriculture, livestock, forestry and nature conservation. During 2009/2010, SUA implemented 130 research projects in collaboration with more than 50 local and international academic and research institutions supported from about 46 local and international donors. SUA is committed to collaborative research with national and international research organizations and seeks research partnerships with them. The university works closely with National Agricultural Research Institutions (NARs) as well as other R&amp;D institutions. SUA has MOUs with National Medical Research Institute of Tanzania (NIMR) that have been pivotal in collaboration between the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at SUA with the medical institutions in the discipline of infectious diseases.  SUA has recently assumed lead partner status in the Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS, www.sacids.org), which is a one health consortium that brings together institutions in Tanzania, DRC-Congo, Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa. Through these initiatives, the Faculty of Veterinary medicine has acquired state of the art laboratory equipment for diagnosis, research and surveillance of infectious agents such as a 3500-Genetic analyzer, real time cycler etc. The Faculty also has more than 60 acres for holding research animals. Currently, through the Feed the Future initiative, USAID and SUA are partnering to leverage research potential at both the University level and at Tanzania’s Zonal Research Centers. Of particular relevance to the export of RVF vaccines to SUA, our USAID project is currently funding the renovation of laboratory space that will comply with Biosafety Level 2 (BSL 2) criteria and will be completed by November 1, 2014, and funds are available to renovate a building to comply with BSL 2 to house livestock that will be used during the latter half of 2015 to evaluate the RVF vaccines and vaccine delivery methods. The SUA Project Director of our USAID supported project on the evaluation of RVF vaccines for protecting livestock provided a letter stating that SUA would comply with UTEP’s Institutional Biosafety and Institutional Animal Care and Use Regulations and Practices (See attached letter dated March 7, 2014 from Professor P. Wambura. Overall, SUA will have the Biosafety infrastructure and expertise and facilities to contain and use the RVF MP-12 vaccines in Biosafety Level 2 facilities in accordance with the USAID’s Initial Environmental Examination and the CDC &amp; P BMBL 5th Edition, December 2009, and in compliance with the University of Texas at EL Paso’s (UTEP) Institutional Biosafety and Institutional Animal Care and Use regulations and policies. </p>
